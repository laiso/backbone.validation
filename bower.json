This class is similar to the collection view classes found in [Backbone.Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette) and other frameworks, with added features for automatic selection of models in response to clicks, and support for rearranging models (and reordering the underlying collection) through drag and drop.",
